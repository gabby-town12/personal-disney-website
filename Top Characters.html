    <!.. intro to list of different characters..>
    <p> Here are my top 10 favorite Disney characters. There are over 800 Disney characters (not counting Marvel or Star Wars) alone. It's very hard not to like at least one Disney character since there are so many. And don't forget about your favorite Marvel superhero or your favorite jedi or droid in Star Wars. I hope you find a character that connects with you. If not, you can come up with your own top 10 list of Disney characters. </p>
    <p class="excited">Enjoy!!!</p>
