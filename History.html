    <p class="info">The Walt Disney Company was first created in the 1920s by Walt Disney. The year 1928 marks the year that Steamboat Willie was released and it was the first animated film with sound that featured the famous character, Mickey Mouse. The very first Disney feature-length animated film was "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" which premiered in 1937. During World War II, Walt Disney's movies didn't do as good as they used to. However, in the 1950s, things started to look a little brighter for Disney. The Disneyland theme park first opened on July 17, 1955. Disneyland is now one of the most poplular theme parks in the world with a total of six parks all across the globe, welcoming millions of visitors through their gates. Unfortunately, Walt Disney passed away on December 15, 1966. Disney may be almost a century old but you'll never be too old to enjoy Disney. </p>

    <p class="info"> Marvel is a very famous brand and they first started in 1939 with the release of the first Timely Comics issue, named "Marvel Comics No.1". After World War II, however, the people started to lose interest in the Marvel superheroes. In the 1960s, Stan Lee caused a revival of the Marvel superheroes.  Marvel Studios was only bought by Disney in 2009, which has only been 11 years, which really isn't a lot. Some of the Marvel movies that have been produced since 2008 with Kevin Fiege as President of Marvel Studios include "Iron Man", "Captain America", "Thor", "Avengers", "Black Panther", "Doctor Strange", and "Spiderman: Homecoming". Their last Marvel movie "Avengers: Endgame" broke box-office records and now holds the record for highest-grossing film earning $2.79 billion worldwide. (Fun Fact: Have you ever wondered why X-Men and the Avengers never met each other on screen before, even though they're both under the Marvel brand? Well the answer is because during the 1990s, Marvel sold the rights to a lot of their characters). </p>
